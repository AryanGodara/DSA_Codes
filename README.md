This is the collection of all the codes that I used for my preparation of DSA and CP.
The sources that I use for learning DSA are :-
1. GFG : I have purchased the Complete Interview Preparation Course ( Which was upgraded from the more basic 'DSA self paced course' that I purchased before this one )
2. Pepcoding : This is a free to use resource, and has a lot of in-depth explanation for almost all the traditional DSA questions, I refer to this after completing a topic on
               GFG, so that I can get two perspectives on the same problem, try to check if I can solve similar problems on my own, and also get a complete revision of the
               concepts learned for the first time from the GFG course.
3. Kunal Kushwaha : This is a channel that posts content related to open source work, I'll be getting into open source after the end of this semester at college, and after
                    completing some more topics from the DSA course (DP , Graphs , Trees, and a revision of Recursion-Backtracking).
                    They also have a github repository where they post a great selection of LeetCode problems, separated according to 'topic' and 'difficulty'. This is a
                    great resource to practice a lot of indirect questions from the topics that I've learned from the DSA courses.
                    I also plan to learn more about open-source from this channel in order to get into some prestigious open-source events.
4. Luv : This is a channel that is great for starting out, and then practicins a 'few but selected' medium to medium-hard questions. There are also shorter playlists for
         learning or revising a lot of features of C++, which help in online competitive programming websites. All in all, it's a great resource to keep my memory fresh,
         or do a quick revision of any topic, even some that are not separately taught in the above mentioned DSA courses.
         It has topics divided based on their practical usage, and not always according to their traditional names like 'hashing' , 'heap' , etc.
5. Code with Harry : This is a great all in one resource for anyone who want to learn literally ANYTHING in the domain of programming. He has a very huge library, and has
                     made content in many different languages, and has tutorials ranging from 100 video long playlists to 12 hour long one-shot tutorial vidoes.
                     I will be primarily using his Web-Development playlist, which consists of about a 100 videos. And also learn in detail about Django, React, Node, etc.
                     These things will most certainly help me go into the 'development phase' especially after I become a 5 star coder on codechef.
                     This will also help me a lot for the internship opportunities that I want to grab in my college days.
