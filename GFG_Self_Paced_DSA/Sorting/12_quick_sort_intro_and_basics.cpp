/*
* Divide and Conquer Algorithm
* 
* O(N^2)
* Despite this, it's considered to be faster than mergesort, because of the following :-
* 1. In-place sorting algo
* 2. Cache-friendly
* 3. Average case is O(NlogN)
* 4. Tail Recursive
* 
* Parition is the key function (naive, lomuto, or hoare) (stable, not stable, not stable)
