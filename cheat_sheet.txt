1. touch .gitignore 	// creates a new txt file called .gitignore // This is a text file, and we enter the names of the folders, whose content we don't want to be uploaded to the repository, maybe they're too large in size. // Eg.: I can write Kunal_DSA/ in the .gitignore file, and it will not upload that folder to the repository

2. git config --global user.name "Aryan"
   git config --global user.email "aryangodara03@gmail.com"	// Sets our name and email

3. git init	// This initializes the repository as a git repository

4. git add . 	// . adds all the files to the staging area, except the ones mentioned in .gitignore , and the .git file is also not here obviously

5. git commit -m "Initial Commit" 	// commit all the files in the staging area, -m "blablabla" is just a message that we want to see, to give us an idea later on about what we did at this point

6. git status 	// Not imp, just to check the current status

7.  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "aryangodara03@gmail.com"	// This command is used to create a new SSH key (Google how to do this)

8. tail <path to id_rsa.pub>
	cat /c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub		// Add this key to your GitHub account

9. git remote add origin <ssh url.git> 	// Replace the content inside the <> with your personal specific, ssh key

10. git push origin master		// Now your project has reached github

a. git add -A OR git add --a : Stages ALL changes
b. git add . : Stages new files and modifications, WITHOUT DELETIONS(on the current directory and subdirectories)
c. git add -u : Stages modifications and deletions, WITHOUT NEW FILES.
