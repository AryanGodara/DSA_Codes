Binary Heap
    Used in Heap Sort
    Used to implement Priority Queue

    Two Types
        Min Heap : Highest priority item is assigned lowest value
        Max Heap : Highest priority item is assigned highest value
    
A Binary Heap is a complete Binary Tree : All of its levels are completely filled, except
possibly the last level, and in that also, the elements must be filled continuously from
left to right, and shoudn't have any gaps between them.
Every node has value that is smaller than its descendants. (value should increase as we go down)
Min Heap is internally represented as an array ( The binary tree is just for representation
here ).
